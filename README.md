#AGS_air_generator
It helps collect informations in .xls or .xlsx files about flight recoders from airlines, then convert them to .air files accepted by ANALYSIS GROUND STATION(AGS), a airplane-analysis-software.
Seriously, it don't invole any informations about any airlines. AGS_air_generator is just a file converter.
Now, It's just begining.
